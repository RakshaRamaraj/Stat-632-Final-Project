#  Multilinear Regression Analysis of Factors Driving Health Insurance Premium
# 
# Scope: 

Insurance companies have been using predictive analysis methods to calculate risk and set premiums for their policies. The insurance premiums are driven by various factors like Age, Sex, BMI etc. This paper aims to show how these factors affect the cost of the insurance price with the help of Linear Regression. Linear regression is a supervised learning approach. It uses the best fit line to build a link between the dependent variable y and one or more independent variables x. It also helps us understand how accurate our model is in predicting the charges with the given variables
We also explored the machine learning algorithm like Random Forest to understand if it improves our predictive model. 


# Data Source: 

The dataset was originally created by US Census Bureau and available on git hub.

Number of rows: 1338

Number of variables: 7

# Data Description

This data shows individual medical costs billed by health insurance companies for a calender year. The data has basic information of the primary policy holder.

# List of variables with description:

• Age: Age of primary beneficiary

• Sex: Gender of the insurance holder (male=1, female=0)

• Bmi: Body mass index, which helps us to provide an understanding of the body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height. An objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9.

• Children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents.

• Smoker: Smoking=1, non smokers=0

• Region: The beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest.

• Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance or the cost is for one calendar year.
